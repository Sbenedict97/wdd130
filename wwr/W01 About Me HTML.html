    <h2>Skyler Benedict</h2>
    <p>Hello everybody, I am Skyler Benedict! I am currently pursuing a career in engineering, and work as an electrical
        engineer's apprentice building electronics for the military. I love going to the gym, working on cars, spending
        time with my dogs, and cooking for friends and family. I had the wonderful opportunity to get married at the
        beginning of this year. Through BYU-Idaho I am looking to attain a Bachelor's degree in applied technology
        before pursing more education from another college. For this course I am interested in learning another skill
        and how more technologies work. I have been a member of the church for 12 years and served my mission in the New
        Hampshire Manchester Mission. One of my favorite talks given is by Elder Uchtdorf titled "Come Join with Us". I
        am eager to get to work along side all of you.</p>
